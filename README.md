Vagrant-based personal network lab - IPv6 Security
==================================================

This is a small self contained lab for playing with IPv6 security tools. It uses [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to run a virtual
Linux server hosting a few [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/) containers
running Ubuntu Linux. For a convenient access to
the consoles of the virtual routers, [ttyd](https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd) is
used to provide web-based terminal access.

The lab is highly customizable using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to
provide the virtual server and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) to do the
configuration. It should work on Windows, macOS and Linux.

Installation of the pre-packaged release (recommended)
------------------------------------------------------

  1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
  2. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
  3. Create an empty folder (for instance `~/ripencc/ipv6seclab`)
  4. Open a terminal window, enter the empty directory (using `cd` command) directory and run `vagrant init ripencc/ipv6seclab` followed by `vagrant up`
  5. Wait a few minutes until vagrant finishes downloading the VM image. The
     size of the image is approximatelly 2 GiB.
  6. Access the lab environment by pointing your web browser to [`http://localhost:8080/`](http://localhost:8080/)
  
Stopping, restarting and destroying the lab
-------------------------------------------

Then, you can turn off the VM by running `vagrant halt` in the same directory
you run `vagrant up` before. You can use the latter command to restart the lab
later.

You can destroy the lab environment by issuing `vagrant destroy`. A subsequent
call of `vagrant up` will bring up a completely fresh environment.

Upgrading to a new version of the lab
-------------------------------------

From time to time, a new version of the lab is released. You can spot it by
the contents of `version.txt` file. If you want to upgrade, run these commands:

    vagrant destroy
    vagrant box update
    vagrant up

Resolving port conflict
-----------------------

In case there is some other software listening on local port 8080, Vagrant will refuse
to start. You can either stop the offending software or adjust Vagrantfile to change
the port number. For example, this is how you move the environment from port 8080 to
port 8081:

```ruby
config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080, host_ip: "127.0.0.1", id: "web", disabled: true
config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8081, host_ip: "127.0.0.1"
```

Then you can find the lab environment on [`http://localhost:8081/`](http://localhost:8081/)

Running the development version
-------------------------------

You can also clone or download this repository and run `vagrant up` there. This
should build a completely new environment from scratch.
